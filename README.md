# BarleyYield-3DPointCloud-ML

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the code, workflow, and data processing pipeline for a UAV-based high-throughput phenotyping approach to predict barley yield under varying nitrogen conditions. The method is described in the paper *"High-Throughput Genotype Screening Under Nitrogen Stress Using UAV-Derived 3D Point Clouds and SHAP-Interpretable Machine Learning"* by Jianye Chang, Avraam Koskosidis, Jason John Walsh, Mortaza Khodaeiaminjan, Feng Qin, Boyuan Zhao, Eleni Mangina, Jue Ruan, and SÃ³nia NegrÃ£o.
