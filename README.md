# BarleyYield-3DPointCloud-ML

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the code, workflow, and data processing pipeline for a UAV-based **high-throughput phenotyping** method designed to predict barley yield under varying nitrogen conditions.  
We integrate **RGB-multispectral sensors** with high-density **3D point cloud reconstruction** to extract growth stage-specific spectral indices and structural traits, enabling **non-destructive, rapid, and multi-site synchronized yield estimation**.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Novel Preprocessing Workflow** â€” Balances model accuracy with growth stage-specific spectral indicators.
- **3D Spectral Indices** â€” Overcome 2D orthomosaic limitations by capturing plant height, biomass, and canopy structure.
- **Higher Prediction Accuracy** â€” RÂ² improved by 18â€“28%, RMSE reduced by 15â€“22% over classical vegetation indices.
- **Low-Nitrogen Robustness** â€” Accurately distinguishes high- and low-yield genotypes under nitrogen stress.
- **Cross-Experiment Scalability** â€” Works across regions and stress conditions.
